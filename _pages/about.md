I'm a Computer Science with a Data Science curriculum student at Ca'Foscari
University of Venice.  
I've worked for almost two years as a mobile developer using Flutter.  
This blog is not purely a technical one but is rather a journal of some of my  
life experiences that most of the time happen to be technology related.

This website is powered by **[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)** [^1].
