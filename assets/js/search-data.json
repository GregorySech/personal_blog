Git add, commit, push and now we wait for the deploy actions to do their job. After letting out my cat I notice that the Actions are all green! YES, success! I rush to click on the link in the README and 404, page not found :( Panic ensures. What did I do wrong? Is it a browser caching problem? CTRL+shift+R, nope :/ Is it because the repository was originally private? Searching mechanism settles in and I stumple upon a Github Community post with a similar problem, hopefully someone else had found a simple solution. Someone advices to choose a Jekyll theme however I do not have a selector like in their screenshot I only have the Source brench dropdown available and with the gh-pages branch selected. Let’s check what that branch contains, looks like a processed static website, at least the website build Action is working. I’mma try changing the branch and then changing it back: the good, old, shut down and restart. Kinda happy that this worked however the prespective of doing this everytime is daunting. . So, what now? . This is kind of the first time blogging so, to tranquilize myself, I’ll expose a kind of roadmap of topics that will be written about. I really enjoy studying data analysis, both the theoretical part and the practical component. So my “serious” posts will start with an introduction of the concepts of data analysis. I cannot assure how many personal posts I will publish before the first technical one but I hope not many. I have no expectencies about who will read this blog so I will try to start from some pretty basic concepts of statistics and machine learning. This will be a pretty useful experience also to review my knowledge before the start of the next academic year. .",
