    "## Introduction\n",
    "Setting up a development environment is not easy if you are inexperienced, especially if a lot of technologies you wish to learn are involved.  \n",
    "This tutorial is aimed to show you how to setup a basic Docker-based Python development environment with CUDA support in PyCharm or Visual Studio Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disclaimers\n",
    "- At the time of writing **I was unable to use CUDA inside of Docker in Windows 10 Home** (even with the Insider build) so this tutorial has been implemented with **Linux** in mind even though there's basically nothing that is platform specific.\n",
    "- Using Docker as a remote Python interpreter with PyCharm is possible only with the Professional edition.\n",
    "- I will assume that you already installed [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) on your machine. \n",
    "- I will assume that you already installed [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) on your machine. If you are still setting up your Linux machine and you are not willing to research much about it I usually recommend [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/). In [this article](https://support.system76.com/articles/cuda/) you can find how to setup CUDA and cuDNN very easily on their platform. The article also provides instructions to use their packages on Ubuntu.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project structure\n",
    "I'm just using 3 files in this toy project:\n",
    "- A `Dockerfile` to generate the container.\n",
    "- A `requirements.txt` file that contains the dependencies of the project.\n",
    "- A `single run.py` file that contains some code to run.\n",
    "Obviously your personal project will most likely be more complex, you may use a different method for dependency management and you might also use a `docker-compose.yaml` file but for the sake of getting my point through that is pointless complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dockerfile\n",
    "\n",
    "For an article more focused on Docker and Dockerfiles I recommend the [Docker Beginner's Guide](https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/docker-beginners-guide-part-1-images-containers-6f3507fffc98).  \n",

    "In layman's terms a `Dockerfile` describes a procedure to generate a Docker image that is than used to create Docker containers. This `Dockerfile` builds on top of the `nvidia/cuda:10.2-devel` [image made available in DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda) directly by NVIDIA.  \n",
    "`nvidia/cuda:10.2-devel` is a development image with the CUDA 10.2 toolkit already installed.   \n",
    "Now just need to install what's needed for Python development and setup our project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the middle section of the `Dockerfile` there is a Miniconda3 installation. I decided to use Miniconda instead of just using Python because it's my go-to platform for most of my projects. We are leveraging **none** of Miniconda capabilities so it is kind of overkill. Swapping out Miniconda with a vanilla installation of Python in the `Dockerfile` is left to the reader as an exercise (do not panic, just use the same commands you would use on a new Ubuntu box).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The last section is about the project setup, we are just installing the dependencies and copying all the files inside the image work directory and choosing the command to launch when `docker run` is called without a specified command.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To build the Docker image just navigate with your shell of choice to the path containing the `Dockerfile` and run:   \n",
    "```bash \n",
    "docker build -t <image_name> .\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will generate the Docker image as described by the configuration and give it the name `image_name`. If in the name no tag is specified **latest** is used as a default. To specify the tag just write it after a colon.   \n",
    "I will use the name `pytorch-development-box` for the image in the rest of the tutorial.\n",
